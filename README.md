# DAY-2(Added Login page)
## 🔐 Authentication & Login System

The application includes a secure **Login Authentication module** to ensure that only authorized users can access the farmhouse financial data. All dashboards and pages are protected using route guards.

---

### 🔹 Login Page
- A clean and responsive login interface for user authentication
- Accepts **email** and **password** credentials
- Displays validation and error messages for invalid login attempts
- Includes demo credentials for quick testing

**Demo Credentials:**
- **Email:** `admin@farmhouse.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`

---

### 🔹 Authentication Logic
- Authentication is handled using a dedicated `AuthService`
- On successful login:
  - User session is stored in `localStorage`
  - User is redirected to the **Home page**
- On logout:
  - Session data is cleared
  - User is redirected back to the **Login page**

---

### 🔹 Route Protection (Auth Guard)
- An `AuthGuard` is implemented to protect sensitive routes:
  - Home
  - Income Dashboard
  - Expense Dashboard
- Unauthorized users are automatically redirected to the Login page
- Direct URL access to protected routes is blocked without authentication

---

### 🔹 Global Navigation Control
- The navigation bar is displayed **only after successful login**
- Navbar is hidden on the Login page
- Logout button is available globally for secure session termination

---

### 🔹 Security Highlights
- Prevents unauthorized access to financial data
- Ensures session-based navigation control
- Clears authentication state on logout
- Supports page refresh while maintaining login state

---

### 🔹 Benefits
- Enhances application security
- Improves user experience
- Prevents accidental data exposure
- Aligns with real-world authentication practices
